How to confirm LSP is running / debugging tips
:LspInfo — shows installed/attached LSP clients for current buffer. If yamlls or ansiblels is not in the attached list, client didn’t start.
:checkhealth — general Neovim health checks (can show issues).
Diagnostics quick check:
:lua vim.diagnostic.open_float() — show diagnostics at cursor
:lua print(vim.inspect(vim.diagnostic.get(0))) — print diagnostics table for buffer
LSP logs: :lua print(vim.lsp.get_log_path()) then open the printed log file to inspect startup errors.
Common causes if LSP not attached:
server binary not found (install it)
filetype not recognized (check :set ft? — should be yaml or ansible)
mason not installed or automatic_installation off
